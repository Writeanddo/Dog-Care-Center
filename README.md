# Dog Care Center

**Dog Care Center** is a mix between first person shooter and pet simulator. As the manager of a little doggy daycare, you have to take care of your clientâ€™s dogs and keep them fed, happy and clean until their owners come back for them! Dream job, you say? Wait until those little puppers start to grow in number!

It was developed for **Ludum Dare 41**, "**Combine 2 Incompatible Genres**".
